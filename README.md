# MVC-PUBG
This is a game weapons introduction website;
 In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.
 In this website, you can see a clear weapons table and information of each weapon.
 Also it includes users log in and register system.
